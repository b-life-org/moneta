## Money in javascript

Money is complex, and the primitives of the language aren't enough to properly
represent it. Moneta is a JavaScript library that lets you express monetary
values, but also perform mutations, conversions, comparisons, formatting, and
overall make money manipulation easier and safer in your application.

## Compatibility

Moneta objects have the same structure as Dinero.js. Functions are also the
same. Switching from one to another is easier.
